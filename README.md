# Terminator 18: Cell Edition

This is a project created by me and my friend Harry Bos. Our goal was to make an unstoppable AI that lived in the virtual world of GTA IV. We somewhat succeeded.

This project uses Tensorflow's Object Detection APIs to recognize in-game objects such as cars, trucks, and people.

Our AI recognizes those objects and then takes actions based on what it sees.
